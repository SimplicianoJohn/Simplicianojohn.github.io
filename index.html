        <h1>About Myself</h1>
        <p>My name is John Simpliciano. I was born in the Philippines but 
            i think i am part Italian due to my last name. I was then raised in  Vancouver
            since i was 1 year old until now. I graduated from Gladstone Secondary School then
             decided to take kinesiolgy at SFU. I didnt like the program there so i decided to 
            trasnfer to BCIT CIT program because i heard a lot of good things about it.</p>
